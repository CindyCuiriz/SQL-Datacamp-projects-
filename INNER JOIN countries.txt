-- |||||||||||||------------------INNER JOIN --------------------||||||||||||||

-- " * " Means "All"

SELECT * 
-- FROM helps you select the database you want to extract the information from
  FROM citiesdb
-- We will create an inner join to the database "countriesdb"
  INNER JOIN countriesdb
-- to match country codes, we use "ON" and choose our "key"
    ON citiesdb.country_code = countriesdb.code;

-- ##-- What are we doing explained with text: --##
-- We request to select all the information from the database "citiesdb", and we want to intersect our data with the database "countriesdb"
-- we will do so on "country_code" from citiesdb database and "code" from countriesdb database
-- The result will be 1 database with records from the two tables whenever there are matching values in country_code and code
-- the result will only show pairs of cities and countries where there is a matching country_code and code between the two tables.

--Creating an Alias: To create an Alias we use "AS"


SELECT 
  city.name AS city,
  country.name AS country,
  region
FROM citiesdb AS city
  INNER JOIN countriesdb AS country
    ON city.country_code = country.code;

-- ##-- What are we doing explained with text: --##
-- We are selecting city.name, country.name and region from our database "citiesdb" aliased as "city" and our database "countriesdb" aliased 
-- as "country", remember: this temporary alias is only for the duration of this query.
-- We request an INNER JOIN between these 2 databases ON country_code and code for city and country respectively.
-- RESULT: 
-- The output will be a combined table with the columns: city, country, and region. The final table will only show matched pairs of cities and 
-- countries based on the country_code and code join condition.
