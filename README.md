# SQL-Datacamp-projects
## The goal of this repository is to show the SQL projects reviewed on "SQL for Joining Data" course from Datacamp
### This course focuses on PostgreSQL and can be applied to different forms of SQL as well

Working with the countries database containing information about the most populous world cities as well as country-level 
economic data, population data, and geographic data. We will use the different Joins to understand how we can create relationships with "Join" functions on sql 

| Join      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Inner Join   | Keeps data that matches a key      |
| Left Join   | Keeps all data from the left table keeping blank data where missing from the right table        |
| Full Join   | All records from left and right and keep missing values from both, combination of left join and right join |
| Cross Join  | It will combine each row from the first rowset with each row from the second rowset |
| Semi Join   | Chooses records on the first table where the condition is met in the second table |
| Anti Join   | Chooses records on the first table where the condition is NOT met in the second table |
| USING( )     | This is used when the key name is the same, you can use it instead of ON |
