# SQL-Datacamp-projects
## The goal of this repository is to showcase my learning from the SQL excercises reviewed on "SQL for Joining Data" course by Dr. Chester Ismay from Datacamp
## Please refer to this course on https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/sql-for-joining-data
#### No copyright intended, just looking to showcase and explain what I learned on this course
### This course focuses on PostgreSQL and can be applied to different forms of SQL as well


I worked with databases that showed countries information including: Population, economics and geographic data.
We will use the different Joins to understand how we can combine databases.


| Join      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Inner Join   | Keeps data that matches a key      |
| Left Join   | Keeps all data from the left table keeping blank data where missing from the right table        |
| Full Join   | All records from left and right and keep missing values from both, combination of left join and right join |
| Cross Join  | It will combine each row from the first rowset with each row from the second rowset |
| Semi Join   | Chooses records on the first table where the condition is met in the second table |
| Anti Join   | Chooses records on the first table where the condition is NOT met in the second table |
| USING( )     | This is used when the key name is the same, you can use it instead of ON |
